Overview
I developed a traffic management system that utilizes computer vision and a web-based dashboard to monitor and analyze traffic in real-time. My system detects and tracks vehicles and pedestrians in a video feed, calculates vehicle density, and displays the data on a dynamic web dashboard.

1. Object Detection and Tracking
YOLO (You Only Look Once)
Purpose: I use YOLO, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system, to detect vehicles and pedestrians in each frame of the video feed.

Implementation: I have integrated the YOLOv8 model for detection using the ultralytics library.

Process: For each frame, YOLO identifies objects and returns their bounding boxes, class IDs, and confidence scores.

DeepSORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)
Purpose: To ensure consistent tracking across frames, I employ DeepSORT, an algorithm that tracks multiple objects, maintaining consistent IDs for each tracked object.

Implementation: I use the deep_sort_realtime library to initialize a DeepSort tracker.

Process: The tracker updates the positions of objects based on YOLO detections, even when objects temporarily leave the frame or are occluded.

2. Data Processing and Calculation
Persistent Counts
Purpose: I maintain a running count of detected objects to avoid resetting counts on page reload.

Implementation: A dictionary persistent_counts helps me keep track of the counts for each class (e.g., car, bus, truck, motorbike, person).

Smoothing Algorithm
Purpose: To smooth out fluctuations in vehicle counts for a more stable and accurate representation.

Implementation: I calculate a moving average using a deque to store recent counts, which mitigates sudden changes due to temporary occlusions or detection errors.

Vehicle Density Calculation
Purpose: I calculate the density of vehicles in the monitored area.

Implementation: Using the formula:

Vehicle Density
=
Number of Vehicles
Area of Observation
where I assume the area is 1 km² for simplicity.

3. Web Application
Frontend Components
HTML Structure: My HTML structure includes sections for the video feed, vehicle counts, color key, loading indicator, error message, and a traffic chart.

CSS Styling: I use CSS to style the components, ensuring a clean and responsive design.

JavaScript: JavaScript helps me dynamically update the counts, chart, and handle loading and error states.

Loading Indicator and Error Handling
Loading Indicator: I display a loading message while fetching data from the server.

Error Handling: I show an error message if there is an issue fetching data.

Chart.js Integration
Purpose: To visualize traffic data trends over time using a line chart.

Implementation: I use the Chart.js library to create and update the chart dynamically.

4. Flask Backend
Endpoint Definitions
Video Feed Endpoint: Streams the video feed to the frontend.

Current Count Endpoint: Provides real-time data on vehicle counts and density.

Flask Routes
/video_feed: Streams the video feed frames.

/current_count: Returns the current counts and density in JSON format.

/: Renders the main dashboard page.
